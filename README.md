This code in C is my first try at creating a final 2D gravitational-force simulation. Right now, the program only allows me to input the masses of two bodies and the distance between them, and then computes the gravitational force using Newton’s law of universal gravitation. It’s a very early prototype,  but it works as a foundation for the full simulation I want to build.
The long-term objective is to create a simple 2D simulation where multiple bodies, chosen and positioned by the user, interact through gravity, updating their positions over time according to the forces they exert on each other. 

Eventually, I want to include:

- position and velocity vectors for each body
- numerical integration (Euler, Verlet, or Runge-Kutta)
- real-time movement on screen (ASCII or graphical output)

This is my first time coding by myself.
